================================================================================

Background:For reconciliations to work, a bank transaction is tied to a payment record which is represented as a transmission. There would often be bank transactions in the Bai Files without an associated transmission.Reasons why bank transactions are not tied to a payment record:Corporate activity (e.g. Treasury funding, interest income, etc)Sweeps between our accounts (e.g. ICP Funding)If the bank transaction does not have a transmission for the reasons above, then Payment Ops would need to create a new electronic payment and then reconcile it to the bank transaction.Process: Go to the Electronic Payment landing page in Panda. Payment Ops > Financial Cleanup > Electronic Payment Creator. Here is also a direct link to the tool: https://app.gusto.com/panda/electronic_payment_creator#choose_use_caseIn most cases, we will select "Copy Reporting" if we know there is an existing transmission. If there is not, we can select "Custom Reporting (Eng Only)"Using the "Copy Reporting" workflow, fill in the following fieldsBank Transaction ID: this will be the string of numbers at the end of the bank transaction URL: ex. https://app.gusto.com/panda/bank_transactions/11953895Original Transmission Type: there will be a dropdown to select the type of transmission Original Transmission ID(s): This will be the original transmission ID we use to create the reporting with this toolSelect "Preview"- If the bank transaction you are reconciling to is a "debit" direction and the original transmission is a "credit", you will need to check "Reverse Direction" to ensure both the bank transaction and new electronic payment have the same payment directionOnce you have confirmed everything is correct, you can review and submit. The new electronic payment will be automatically reconciled to the bank transmission used!Custom Reporting (Eng Only)If you need to use the Custom Reporting (Eng Only) flow, use extreme caution and always consult a payments reporting SME (Ops folks who are fully ramped onto the Payment Investigations rotation) to ensure that your transmission has correct reporting. Incorrect payments reporting data can cause downstream balance validation, customer refund, and Accounting issues.Query for sample/reference info for the Payment Record Information section: https://redash.zp-int.com/queries/60630/source EP Creator Tool - Custom Reporting flow - Sample PR/PRE info
