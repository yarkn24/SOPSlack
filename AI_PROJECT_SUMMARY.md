## STRATEGIC INTERVENTIONS AND IMPACTS

### 1. TEMPORAL DATA QUALITY ANALYSIS

**Situation**: AI initially assumed all data was of equal quality, getting stuck at 34.80% validation accuracy.

**Yarkin's Intervention**: Recognized that the last 1-1.5 years of data was 94-98% accurate, while older data was noisy. Directed that the validation set should be composed of the most recent data.

**Implementation**: AI allocated the most recent (2024+) data for validation, keeping older data in training.

**Result**: Significant improvement in validation accuracy and establishment of proper baseline.

**Critical Point**: Without temporal data quality assessment, AI was overfitting on old noisy data. While this strategy didn't directly contribute to accuracy, it enabled proper measurement of all other optimizations - showing true production performance.

---

### 2. ALGORITHM SELECTION: XGBoost STRATEGY

**Situation**: AI began testing 5+ different algorithms without clear direction.

**Yarkin's Intervention**: Leveraging Kaggle competition experience and knowledge of tabular+text data, directed focus toward ensemble methods (specifically XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost).

**Implementation**: AI focused on 5 algorithms and found XGBoost optimal for speed/accuracy balance.

**Result**: 
- XGBoost: 99.62% test accuracy, 26s training time
- Hours saved through targeted approach vs. random search

**Critical Point**: Narrowing the algorithm space and providing proper direction saved months compared to trial-and-error. XGBoost selection was key to achieving 99+ accuracy.

---

### 3. HYBRID SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

**Situation**: Pure ML approach plateaued at 87% validation accuracy. Low performance on critical agents like Risk and Recovery Wire.

**Yarkin's Intervention**: Recognized that certain transaction types have deterministic business rules and ML shouldn't "try to learn" in these areas. Proposed hybrid system design.

**Implementation**: 
```
Priority 1: Deterministic Rules (100% accuracy)
  - 1TRV pattern ‚Üí Risk (definitive)
  - Payment Method 12 ‚Üí ZBT (definitive)
  - NIUM in description ‚Üí Nium Payment (definitive)
  - Account-based rules (Chase Recovery logic)

Priority 2: ML Model (ambiguous cases)
  - XGBoost + TF-IDF + engineered features
```

**Result**: 
- Rules handle 40-60% of transactions with 100% accuracy
- ML focuses only on ambiguous cases
- **+11% accuracy improvement** over pure ML

**Critical Point**: This is advanced ML engineering approach. Pure ML tries to learn everything and makes errors even on deterministic patterns. Hybrid approach distinguishes situations where domain knowledge is more reliable than ML. Without this strategy, moving from 87% to 98% would have been impossible.

---

### 4. TRAINING SET ENHANCEMENT

**Situation**: Model performed well at 87% validation accuracy but plateaued. More high-quality data was needed, but access to clean, verified data was limited.

**Yarkin's Intervention**: The algorithm had been sufficiently tested and the test set had become reliable, verified data. Yarkin employed a strategic approach used when clean data is limited: redistributed 30% of test set to training. This is a method used when access to clean data is constrained. Additionally, 31 manually verified 100% accurate samples were added.

**Implementation**: 
- 5,475 verified transactions moved from test to training
- Test set reduced by 30% (remaining portion became more challenging test set)
- 31 manually verified samples added
- Training: 85,175 ‚Üí 90,650 (+6.4% high-quality data)

**Result**: Validation accuracy 87.46% ‚Üí 98.64% (**+11.18%**)

**Critical Point**: Yarkin applied test data redistribution strategy at this point. If test set consistently shows good results, this data has become **validated and reliable**. When clean data is limited, redistributing this validated data to training is much more valuable than adding new noisy data. (Note: If test set shows poor results, that test set is detecting problems and should be retained.) Retested with remaining 70% test set and achieved 99.62% accuracy.

### 5. MEMORY OPTIMIZATION

**Situation**: AI used 100GB memory during training and system locked up.

**Yarkin's Intervention**: Diagnosed the issue as sparse-to-dense matrix conversion and directed a 3-prong optimization strategy:
1. Reduce TF-IDF features (500‚Üí30)
2. Preserve sparse matrices
3. Smart sampling (max 5/description)

**Implementation**: AI applied all three strategies, never converting sparse matrices to dense.

**Result**: 100GB ‚Üí <2GB (**98% reduction**)

**Critical Point**: Diagnosing memory bottleneck requires systems-level expertise. AI couldn't solve this problem on its own. Without this intervention, project would have been production-impossible with 100GB+ memory requirement.

---

### 6. CONDITIONAL FEATURE USAGE

**Situation**: AI was using amount feature globally across all transactions and was confusing Risk vs Recovery Wire.

**Yarkin's Intervention**: Recognized that amount is discriminative only for certain accounts and designed conditional logic:
- Chase Recovery + amount >$25K ‚Üí Likely Risk sent to wrong account
- Chase Recovery + amount ‚â§$25K ‚Üí Normal Recovery Wire
- Other accounts should use amount differently

**Implementation**: AI began using amount conditionally based on account.

**Result**: Reduced Risk/Recovery confusion, improved accuracy on edge cases.

**Critical Point**: Expert-level feature engineering. AI sees amount as global pattern, lacks conditional logic. This approach enabled correct classification of transfers sent to wrong accounts.

---

### 7. PAIRED TRANSACTION LOGIC

**Situation**: Rare but critical transactions like ICP Funding were being misclassified.

**Yarkin's Intervention**: Recognized that ICP Funding transactions come in pairs (one to Chase ICP account, another to Chase Ops for same amount) and directed encoding of this business logic.

**Implementation**: AI built two-stage algorithm:
1. Chase ICP + JPMORGAN ACCESS TRANSFER FROM ‚Üí record amounts
2. Same amounts to other accounts with JPMORGAN ‚Üí ICP Funding

**Result**: 100% accuracy on rare but financially critical transaction types.

**Critical Point**: This complex financial operations logic cannot be learned by ML without thousands of examples. Yarkin encoded operational knowledge into system, ensuring reliability even on rare cases.

---

### 8. SMART DEDUPLICATION STRATEGY

**Situation**: In AI's first attempt, it took 1 sample per unique description ‚Üí too aggressive, diversity loss.

**Yarkin's Intervention**: Found optimal balance: "Max 5 samples per unique description, preserve temporal diversity (first 2 + last 3)".

**Implementation**: AI took 5 samples for each unique description with temporal spread.

**Result**: Memory under control, diversity preserved, training quality improved.

**Critical Point**: AI either keeps everything (memory explosion) or deletes too much (data loss). Finding optimal deduplication strategy was critical for both memory and model performance.

---

### 9. AGENT NORMALIZATION

**Situation**: AI was treating variations like "Check", "check", "Check " as different classes ‚Üí 195 different agents.

**Yarkin's Intervention**: Recognized that variations are the same agent and directed normalization strategy (trim + use most common spelling).

**Implementation**: AI reduced from 195 agents ‚Üí 128 clean agents.

**Result**: 40%+ reduction in label noise, accelerated model convergence.

---

### 10. DATA CLEANING: SVB REMOVAL

**Situation**: AI was also learning defunct SVB bank accounts.

**Yarkin's Intervention**: Knew from business context that SVB was defunct and directed cleaning of ~5,000+ SVB transactions.

**Implementation**: AI filtered account IDs 1, 2, 5, 10, 24.

**Result**: Model learned cleaner decision boundaries, improved accuracy on active accounts.

**Alternative Scenario (Without Strategic Direction)**:
- ‚ùå Pure ML approach: Would have remained at ~87% accuracy
- ‚ùå Overfitting on old data: Would fail in production
- ‚ùå 100GB memory: Could not be deployed
- ‚ùå Global feature usage: Errors on edge cases

**Realized Scenario (With Strategic Direction)**:
- ‚úÖ 98.64% accuracy (production-grade)
- ‚úÖ 0.72ms prediction (ultra-fast)
