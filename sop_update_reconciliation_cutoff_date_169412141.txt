================================================================================

OverviewAt the end of every FY, the Payment Ops team updates the reconciliation cutoff date to prevent transactions from previous FYs from being updated. This freezes old historic reconciliation data and can only be updated if Platform Accounting approves it. If the cutoff date needs to be changed for any reason, it will require: Platform Accountings approval Payments Jira for documentation Emailed request to platform-accounting@gusto.comProcedureOnce the FY ends, Payment Ops will email platform-accounting@gusto.com to request formally that the cutoff date will be changed to the end of the previous FY. So if FY25 just started, the cutoff date would be the end of FY24, which is "2024-04-30"If Accounting approves the request on the email, then create a Payments Jira documenting the changeEX: System Jiraf98f4637-3689-3a9f-9a9c-a6609f1b14edPAYENG-7509Adjust the cutoff date on this Panda page: https://app.gusto.com/panda/business_values/356/editOnce the business value is updated, it needs to be approved.
