================================================================================

https://app.gusto.com/panda/repayment_reporterBackground: What problem are we solving and why?When payroll debits fail for 2 day or expedited payrolls, we will re-attempt a debit, but a client will occasionally choose to wire Gusto the funds instead. When these wires are received, they show up unreconciled on the BAI files. This tool allows us to manually reconcile the wires that are received.The tool will create an electronic payment with the payment records from the failed debits and also reconcile that electronic payment against the bank transaction.The tool can also create electronic payments to essentially mirror the original transmission. This tool can be used for any payment method, not just payrolls. 8/20 Update - Repayment Reporter Tool now supports Partial Recovery where the amount is lower than the amount of the original transmissions (e.g. recovered LOI funds). This tool does not currently support cases where there are overpayments or multiple wires were sent.StepsFrom the bank transaction, select “Reconcile via Full Repayment Reporter”Enter the bank transaction IDFrom the payroll that funds were recovered for, click on the debit nacha entries that failedCopy transmission ID (7756732173524042) from the url (https://app.gusto.com/panda/nacha_entries/7756732173524042)- from the failed DEBIT nacha entriesNavigate back to your open window of the Repayment Reporter Enter the transmission IDs from the failed debits. Separate multiple IDs with a comma. Reverse Reporting?Default = unchecked. If the payment direction of the Transmission ID you inputted does not match the Bank Transaction payment direction, check this box.Examples: Original transmission is a a credit, but the unreconciled wire is a debit → check Reverse Reporting? boxOriginal transmission is a debit, unreconciled wire is a debit → leave Reverse Reporting? box uncheckedOmit Payment Account?Default = unchecked. Only check this box if you are recording a payment for a pre-Finroll payment (before 5/1/20) AND are getting an error message once you hit Submit.Some Finroll data for has been backfilled for pre-Finroll events. If that is the case, omitting Finroll data with this tool can cause downstream functionality issues for other Ops tools.Before checking this box, always attempt to use the tool with the box unchecked first because Finroll data may exist even if the payment was before 5/1/20.The payment date  is < 5/1/20 AND you received a “payment line items are not present” error message on your 1st attempt, then you can 1) select the Omit Payment Account box and 2) retry the tool.Partial Repayment?      a. Default = unchecked. Only check this box if you're reconciling a bank transaction where the amount is less than the total amount of the original transmissions.This usually should only be used if Collections/Risk lets us know we need to record for a partial wire/recovery case, or a wire/ICP wire return was sent back to us with the amount less than what we sent out.Click SubmitIf the sum of the payment records does not equal the bank transaction amount, an error message will appear.Example Jira Tickets:https://jira.gustocorp.com/browse/PAYENG-1592https://jira.gustocorp.com/browse/PAYENG-1455https://jira.gustocorp.com/browse/PAYENG-2865 (Using Partial Recovery Option)
