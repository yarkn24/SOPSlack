## 📧 EMAIL TEMPLATE TO SEND

```
Subject: CODE7 Development Documentation - AI-Powered Reconciliation

Hi Zhe,

Thanks for requesting the detailed walkthrough. I've prepared a comprehensive package explaining CODE7's development, architecture, and AI tooling approach.

**Deliverables:**

1. **Loom Video** (10 min): End-to-end walkthrough of the build process
   Link: [INSERT LOOM LINK HERE]

2. **Comprehensive Written Summary** (`CODE7_DEVELOPMENT_SUMMARY.md`)
   - Full architecture & data flow
   - Rule logic & ML components
   - Development timeline & iterations
   - Validation results & metrics

3. **Architecture Diagram** (`ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md`)
   - Visual system overview
   - Component interactions
   - Data flow sequences

4. **Prompt Engineering Export** (`CURSOR_PROMPTS_EXPORT.md`)
   - Chronological prompt history
   - What worked vs. what didn't
   - Iteration examples

5. **Source Code**: GitHub repo SOPSlack
   - All code files with inline comments
   - Configuration examples
   - Development history

**Key Highlights:**

- Built entirely with Cursor AI Agent (~85% AI-generated code)
- Hybrid approach: 60% rule-based, 40% ML
- Improved from 33% → 98% accuracy through systematic iteration
- Estimated 10 hrs/week time savings across team
- Currently testing with ops team for validation metrics

**What's Documented:**

✓ Problem statement & business context
✓ Complete architecture & tech stack
✓ Business rules + ML model details
✓ All AI assistants & prompts used
✓ Generated code breakdowns
✓ Validation framework & baselines
✓ Output consumption workflow

**Next Steps:**

- Complete real-world testing with team (in progress)
- Measure actual prediction acceptance rates & time saved
- Will share validation metrics once collected

All documentation files are attached and also available in the GitHub repo. Happy to discuss any aspect in more detail.

Best,
Yarkin

## 🎬 BEFORE RECORDING LOOM

### Setup Checklist:
- [ ] Close unnecessary applications
- [ ] Turn off notifications (Slack, email, etc.)
- [ ] Clean desktop/visible windows
- [ ] Test microphone audio quality
- [ ] Test screen recording quality
- [ ] Open files you'll reference:
  - [ ] Cursor IDE with SOPSlack project
  - [ ] code7.py
  - [ ] labeling_rules.py
  - [ ] predict_with_rules.py
