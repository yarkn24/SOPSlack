================================================================================

Background: The Fraud team sends Letters of Instruction (LOIs) to Chase in order to recover funds that were mistakenly or fraudulently transferred to an incorrect account. However, when these partial recoveries are returned to Gusto, they often lack specific details about the associated case. Currently, the process involves escalating this information to Chase's fraud team, which requires at least 3 business days for investigation due to its manual nature.As of 3/31/25 Chase informed us that we’re able to self-serve to locate the case in our email back on the customer reference number! Locate the customer reference on the bank transaction. In this example, this LOI for $52,421.01 has a customer reference number that says 2502280267This field will tell you what JPA investigation ID this return is associated with. Unfortunately, this field is limited to 10 characters and the JPA investigations ID’s are 12, so the first 6 digits is the date and then you’ll need to put leading zero’s to make the last 6.
It’s a partial credit of case ID 2502280267 From there, you can plug in the JPA Investigation ID into your search box in your email to locate the case - I plugged in JPA250228-000267 in the email inbox to look it up. You’ll want to locate the earliest email from CB Fraud Support with this investigation ID so you can see the original payment(s) the LOI was for. In this case, I opened up the CB Fraud Support email sent on 2/28/25Open up the email and scroll down until you see details related to JPA250228-000267You’ll see in this email that the LOI was sent for two payments for $29,000.00 and $28,000.00In the same email, scroll to the bottom where you’ll see two attachments. You’ll want to open up the one titled “Agreement and Schedule for Case [XXXXXXX]” as this contains the information about the original payment(s) the LOI was sent forOnce you open the attachment, scroll down until you see the Schedule 1 section. You’ll be able to locate the payments for $29,000.00 and $28,000 for Todd S. that the partial LOI was recovered for.In this case, we received $52,421.01 out of $57,000 ($29,000.00 + $28,000.00)From there, you can locate the NACHAs related to the payments by using this query and using the individual ID(s) # that starts with the “6sem….” code to look up the nachas and reconcile!Please continue to forward these LOIs to the Fraud team and inform them if we need to have the funds kept with Gusto, or returned to the company’s bank account on file
