================================================================================

Background:These reconciliation errors are triggered around 9:45AM PST after general and critical system maintenance jobs have completed. Note: Join the #maintenance slack channel to see when maintenance is completed.Once maintenance is completed, a job runs which checks for unreconciled amounts for each bank transaction type. These alerts will be in the #payment-alerts-temp channelView the error types below:Transmission Reconciliations: Unreconciled Check PaymentsWill not be reconciled until checks are tracked either/or cashed. Up to agency to cash the check payment.Transmission Reconciliations: Unreconciled Electronic Payments Excluding Reverse Wire And Wire InElectronic Payments that have not been reconciled with a bank transaction.  Up to agency to debit us.Transmission Reconciliations: Unreconciled Electronic Payments For Reverse Wire And Wire InShould all be reconciled every day - if there's any unreconciled electronic payments in this queue, please investigate to see if this is a duplicate electronic payment or if we never received the wire.If we never received the wire but credits went out, this is dangerous since Gusto is now at a loss for funding a payroll when we never collected funds.Transmission Reconciliations: Unreconciled Nacha BatchesThese should reconcile or have an identifiable dependency (i.e. same day and flex pay files that will reconcile the next day). If a large volume (more than 100) fires off, please investigate and surface to Payments Eng if necessary. Transmission Reconciliations: Unreconciled Nacha Entry ReturnsThese should reconcile the next day. If a large volume (more than 100) fires off, please investigate and surface to Payments Eng if necessaryTransmission Reconciliations: Unreconciled Wire PaymentsIMPORTANT: Should all be reconciled every day - if we see any unreconciled wire payments, this should be investigated immediately since this could mean a wire payment failed for an EE or an IRS paymentIf IRS wire payments are unreconciled, please check if it was part of the Domestic Wire File and if it was sent and uploaded successfullyIf it's an unreconciled EE wire payment, this may be related to an expedite request from Risk/CX.
