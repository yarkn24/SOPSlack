Link - https://app.gusto.com/panda/microvariance_adjusterUse: Payment Ops is able to use the microvariance adjuster tool to mass resolve and reconcile electronic payments when there is a large volume of tax liabilities that are unable to be reconciled due to minor amount differences that may be due to a slight rate change that the tax agency had implemented or rounding issues. IMPORTANT NOTE: START AND END DATE - ENTER IN PERIOD OF ELECTRONIC PAYMENT NOT TAX FILING PERIOD. Electronic Payments to Ignore - If there are EP’s that have been recognized that do not need the microvariance adjuster. If none, then leave this line blank. Check in the Payments-Alerts channel for the microvariance adjuster tool to be done running.   Next, check if the EP’s have been adjusted. Spot check Electronic Payments that were not auto-reconciled. If electronic payments were not adjusted, try using/expanding out your date parameter.If the microvariance adjuster tool did work, next would be to use the Reconciler Tool to resolve out any unreconciled bank transactions that was because of microvariance tool. Please follow the confluence page for the Reconciler Tool SOP.
