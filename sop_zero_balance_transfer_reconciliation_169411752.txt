================================================================================

What is a Zero Balance Transfer? (ZBT)A ZBT is a special type of bank transaction that Gusto will see on our Wire in and Operations accounts. Customers will send in wires throughout the day to the wire in accounts and at the end of the day, the bank will sweep all funds out of the accounts into the respective Operations accounts. Chase Incoming Wire and Chase Wire In will get swept into the Chase Operations account, while the PNC Wire In account will get swept into the PNC Operations account. Wire In Accounts:Chase Wire InChase Payroll Incoming WiresPNC Wire InZBT bank transactions will always be credits out of the wire in accounts, and debits into the operation accounts:Credit out of the Chase Wire In Account for $949,026.74Debit into the Chase Operations Account for $949,026.74 The transactions represent that we received $949,026.74 into the Chase Wire In account on December 1st 2023 and we moved all of those funds into the Chase Operations account at the end of the day. How Do We Reconcile ZBTs?Fortunately for us, reconciliations for ZBTs are automated! You might see unreconciled ZBTs everyday in the recon queue, but fear not because typically a ZBT will get reconciled on the next business day barring a very important requirement!All wire ins for a particular day need to be reconciled in order for the ZBT reconciler to create the EP to reconcile the ZBTIf all wire ins are reconciled but the ZBT isn't reconciled yet, it could be because the Wire In was reconciled past 7 days of when it was createdReach out to Payments Eng on-call to manually run the ZBT EP creator job if this is the caseThere are two important jobs that run to reconcile ZBTsThe first job happens at 3:30 PM PT where the ZBT job creates the EPThe second job happens at 4:00 PM PT where the last reconciliation run captures and auto-reconciles the ZBTsAdditionally, please note that Chase will sweep all funds out of the wire accounts each day at 6:17 PM ET. Any wires that are sent to our wire-in accounts after that time will be included in the next day’s sweeps.ZBT Reconciliation Investigation Videohttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1XBO0vImIW27ACtyAZuwOpiQr-YXYm74B/view?usp=sharingTimeline of eventsAdmins wire in payrolls on Day 1Bank moves all wired in funds out of the wire in accounts into the ops accounts at EoD 1We see unreconciled ZBT + Wire ins on Day 2, when looking at previous day BAI reportingWhatever Wire Ins are reconciled on Day 2 will get packaged into a ZBT EP EoD 2If there are any remaining Wire Ins on Day 3 and they are reconciled on Day 3, ZBT EP creator job will create an EP for those wire ins EoD 3ZBT BTs are reconciled!Examples:This was reconciled BD2, as Dec 2-3 was the weekendSince it was reconciled BD2 it was only reconciled to 1 EPThis was reconciled on BD3, as Dec 2-3 was the weekendIf it were to be reconciled on BD2 it would be reconciled on Dec 1, but since a wire in was unreconciled, this was reconciled a day after the wire in was reconciledIf there are multiple ZBT EPs then that means that it was delayed due to missing reconciled Wire InsEdge Cases:ZBT EPs equal more than the amount of the ZBT BTThis has happened once so far, but it happened because the Wire In approval job tied a wire to the wrong payrollBT of the ZBT on 1/12/24 for $7,222,901.85BT link: https://app.gusto.com/panda/bank_transactions/38009804EP of the ZBTs for 1/12/24Electronic payment #3771221 for $437,395.31Electronic payment #3759670 for $6,786,616.04These sum up to $7,224,011.35, which is $1,109.50 more than what the ZBT BT isWhat happened?The system automatically approved this payroll, when in fact we didn't actually receive this wireAmanda unreconciled this wire the next day, but it was already included in the ZBT EPHow do we resolve?We will need to re-create the ZBT EP using the EP creator tool and will need to remove the entries that shouldn't be included in the ZBT EP, this should be done to both EPs (wire in and ops)Once entries are removed, the transaction and transmissions should be reconciiled
