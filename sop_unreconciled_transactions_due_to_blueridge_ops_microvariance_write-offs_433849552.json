  "content": "<h2>🎯 Purpose</h2><p>To identify and resolve recurring unreconciled transactions caused by the current Modern Treasury&rsquo;s (MT) reconciliation logic&rsquo;s inability to handle large volumes of transactions with identical dollar amounts. </p><h2>📚 Background</h2><p>We&rsquo;ve observed a recurring issue over the past few quarters related to unreconciled transactions stemming from Blueridge operations&rsquo; microvariance write-offs. The core issue stems from MT&rsquo;s reconciliation engine struggling to accurately match multiple transactions with the same dollar amount due to its current logic.</p><p>Since our reconciliation process relies heavily on MT&rsquo;s API, these transactions fail to be captured automatically, leading to gaps in reconciliation.</p><h2>⚠️ Why This Is Problematic</h2><ul><li><p>🔍 <strong>Data Integrity Risks:</strong> Unreconciled transactions undermine the accuracy and reliability of our financial data, leading to incomplete or inconsistent reporting.</p></li><li><p>🤝 <strong>Reduced System Trust:</strong> Stakeholders lose confidence in our system&rsquo;s ability to reflect the true financial state.</p></li><li><p>⏳ <strong>Operational Inefficiency:</strong> Manual interventions increase the risk of human error and slow down financial close processes.</p></li><li><p>📈 <strong>Scalability Concerns:</strong> Manual workarounds are unsustainable as transaction volumes grow, impacting productivity.</p></li></ul><h2>💥 Impact</h2><ul><li><p>🚫 <strong>Unreconciled Transactions:</strong> A significant volume of distinct payments remain unmatched due to identical values.</p></li><li><p>🛠️ <strong>Manual Workarounds:</strong> Current manual reconciliation is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and not scalable.</p></li><li><p>❌ <strong>MT Support Limitations:</strong> MT&rsquo;s support team has declined manual reconciliation requests due to potential downstream impacts.</p></li></ul><h2>🛠️ Current Workaround</h2><ul><li><p>🔎 Manual reconciliation using <strong>fuzzy matching</strong> techniques to approximate and reconcile transactions with identical dollar amounts that fail strict matching.</p></li><li><p>📄 Usage of an impact sheet documenting affected payments to track unmatched transactions.</p></li></ul><h2>🚀 Request for Improvement</h2><p>We seek to explore a long-term, automated solution that could involve:</p><ul><li><p>⚙️ Reviewing and modifying MT&rsquo;s reconciliation rules or logic to better handle identical-dollar transactions.</p></li><li><p>🤖 Implementing a new reconciliation rule or AI-driven fix to auto-reconcile these transactions efficiently.</p></li><li><p>📉 Reducing manual intervention and improving reconciliation throughput.</p></li><li><p>💸 Impact from last two quarters:<br />Q3 FY25: 855 transactions worth $174.18</p><p>Q4 FY25: 369 transactions worth $89.44</p></li></ul>",
