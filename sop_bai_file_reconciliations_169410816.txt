Background: What is a BAI file?A Bank Administration Institute, or BAI file, is an official file format for performing electronic cash management balance reporting published by our banks of all of our transaction. BAI File reconciliation is the process of verifying transmissions in our system with money in our bank account represented as a bank transaction. Our system runs daily auto reconcilers which would ideally reconcile out every bank transaction that appears on our BAI File. Bank transactions remaining in the BAI File are those could not be automatically reconciled and require manual reconciliation by Payments Ops.The Different BAI files that Gusto ReceivesPNCPrevious day customer cash + corporate activityChasePrevious day customer cash + corporate activityCurrent day transactions for the Reverse Wire Account onlyWill receive at 8:45 am & 9:30 am PSTPhase 1: BAI File Manual ReconciliationReconciliations are normally handled on the Reconciliations Queue, but here are instructions on how to reconcile on the BAI file if needed.Â Manually Reconcile Bank TransactionsWhere to find the BAI file:In the #payment-alerts-temp channel, after the auto reconcilers run, if there are unreconciled BAI Files the validation error alert will appear:The BAI file page on PandaUnreconciled Bank Transactions will show up on the BAI file, like they would for the Reconciliations Queue.
