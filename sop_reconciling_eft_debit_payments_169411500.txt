Title: Reconciling EFT Debit Payments

================================================================================

Sometimes, we pay agencies through EFT Debit. In this process, a Gustie (probably on Tax Ops) will pay by entering Gusto's credit card into the agency's portal essentially allowing the agency to pull from our account. However, this sometimes causes issue for reconciliation because the bank transaction's payment method does not match the transmission's payment method.When this happens, three things can occur:a. There is no transmission  → Resolution: Re-open the MasterTax file and Re-Process to create an electronic payment b. There is a check transmission  → Resolution: Re-issue the MasterTax file and Re-Process to create an electronic payment. Make sure to also void the check payment if it wasn't sent.c. There is a voided check transmission → Resolution: Re-issue the MasterTax file and Re-Process to create an electronic payment. d. [Potential Scenario] The amount on the transmission doesn't match the bank transaction (because we needed to add a liability?) →  Resolution: Re-open the MasterTax fileBackground: For ETF Debit, TaxOps compared the payment generated by the Agency to the filing amount. If there are any discrepancies at his point, they should always be fixed before paying the taxes.A general rule of thumb is: If there is a transmission to begin with, then re-issue. If not, then re-open.For each case above, ask Tax Ops to check if the payment has the correct payment method. If not, they will need to follow the steps below in order to create a correct transmission and enable Payment Ops reconcile the bank transaction.Individual CompanyRe-Opening/Re-Issuing Log into MasterTax (make sure you are on the VPN)       2.

Once it does, you can reconcile the bank transaction!Bulk Payment for Multiple CompaniesSteps to Resolution:Log into MasterTax (make sure you are on the VPN) Search MasterTax for the deposit id provided on the agent payment to get the Tax Ops team member who made the payment and the date/timeGo to Utilities → Process historyLook up the payment by creator and date/timeHover over the green button and click "Run Report" to get the Process ID of the payment (which corresponds to the Bulk Payment?) Look up the Process ID though Deposit Maintenance → Show Additional OptionsFilter by "Deposit Payment Process ID"Click "Select All" to either Re-Open or Re-Issue the payment. Example Jiras for Historical Issues with Bulk Payments:a. System Jiraf98f4637-3689-3a9f-9a9c-a6609f1b14edPAYENG-1586b. System Jiraf98f4637-3689-3a9f-9a9c-a6609f1b14edPAYMENTS-1662c.  System Jiraf98f4637-3689-3a9f-9a9c-a6609f1b14edVM-13479Things to watch out for:Manual pay When payments in MasterTax are labeled as "Manual Pay" it usually means we are not supposed to pay it out. Example: We refunded the employer for it so we shouldn't pay it out to the agency.Potential Root CausesThe Agency's payment method use to be check and Tax Ops is changing it to be EFT debit Perhaps when switching the payment method, Tax Ops did not set the "EFT Start date" correctly. This date must be before period end date of the payment in question EFT Debit was the intent all along but Tax Ops never changed the payment method from check to EFT debitSince the payment is EFT debit, perhaps tax ops thought that what was represented in Mastertax did not matter and therefore left the payment method as "check payment"Tax Ops did originally send a check to the agency but the agency returned the check and to avoid P&I Tax Ops decided to pay by EFT Debit
