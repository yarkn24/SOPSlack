================================================================================

Background: The auto-reconciler job captures and reconciles 99% of our bank transactions, however there are exceptions that aren’t captured that the team will look into and need to surface to our x-functional partners in a timely manner.ACH TransactionsACH transactions typically get auto-reconciled, however if you’re seeing any unreconciled ACH transactions, please use this query to locate the NACHA batch based on the entry descriptionIf you’re unable to locate a relevant batch, please surface this to #eng-payments immediately for assistance and tag

Timeline to investigate/surface: Same Dayexample slackModern Treasury ReturnsModern Treasury returns typically get reconciled later in the day due the timing of the reconciliation logic (happens at 11 PM PT on the same day we see the transactions)If the returns do not get reconciled the day after, please surface to Modern Treasury for investigation in the #support-gusto-mt channel and tag

Timeline to investigate/surface: Same Dayexample slackWire PaymentsWire Payments will get auto-reconciled each day. However, there have been some exceptions where it’s not auto-reconciled because the wire payment was released late due to various reasons (e.g. delayed due to sanctions and awaiting reply from Payment Ops - these are usually always related to IRS wires)If you see any unreconciled wire payments, please utilize the Unreconciled Wire Payments investigations page to locate the wire payment transmission and manually reconcileTimeline to investigate/surface: Same DayGrasshopper Ops TransactionsTypically, we’ll see most of our bank transactions created and auto-reconciled before 10 AM PST. However, with the new Grasshopper Ops integration, we will see some payments that come after 10 AM PST into our reconciliation queueThese are same day ACH payments processed by Grasshopper Ops, as they’re submitted on the day of the payment creation to Modern Treasury and auto-reconciled around 10 - 10:15 AM PST.TL;DR If you see any Grasshopper Ops transactions, please do not label them to avoid counting them as manual recon, as they will be auto-reconciled by the systemHowever, if you see any Grasshopper Ops transactions that haven’t been reconciled for more than a few hours, please surface this over to Payments Eng and tag
