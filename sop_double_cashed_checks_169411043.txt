================================================================================

Background: Payment Ops will see some unreconciled check payments related to double cashed checks. Because the first check was already reconciled by the system to the respective check payment transmission, the system will not reconcile the second one automatically.Payment Ops will need to do the following to investigate if it is a true double cashed check:1. Log into the Chase portal2. Click Checks → Under the dropdown, click Home3. Click Inquiry → Check Inquiry           a. You only need to put one of the three fields that are asterisked - I would recommend just putting the Check number4. Once you pull up the check image, you'll see an asterisk* next to the Check/Serial column. This denotes that the check was cashed twice:5. After you've determined it's a double cashed check, please send an email to kayla.bonnell@jpmorgan.com and cc platform_ops@gusto.com         a. Please put the subject line in the email as Double Cashed Check followed by the Check number e.g. Double Cashed Check - #393780.Note: If there’s multiple double cashed checks, you can write Double Cashed Check and followed by the total count and dollar amount of the impacted checks         b. Include the screenshot of the double cashed check, dollar amount, check number, account it was sent from (x7908), and dates.6. An investigator will be assigned to the email - if the investigation is successful, a credit adjustment will be sent back to Gusto.7. In the meantime, you can reconcile the check - but please remember to drop a comment on the check payment AND the agent payment noting that it's double cashed and we're waiting for an adjustment:  8. Once the credit adjustment has been sent back to Gusto, it'll look like this:9. From there, you can use the Repayment Reporter tool and use the Check Payment transmission to reconcile this! Please remember to check the Reverse Reporting box as well.
