  "title": "Run Reconciler SOP for Electronic Payments",
  "id": "169411456",
  "content": "<p>Oftentimes, for EFT debit agencies there is a 1:1 match in terms of electronic payment to bank transaction on a per company basis. What this means is that we can encounter common situations where hundreds (or even thousands) of bank transactions can come in without automatically reconciling to an electronic payment. This is where the 'Run Reconciler' tool becomes useful! A few things to note:</p><ul><li>This reconciler is specific to only electronic payments. No other transmission type will be affected.&nbsp;</li><li>With great power comes great responsibility. We want to make sure we've very deliberate when using this tool and be as specific as possible when setting the parameters.&nbsp;</li><li>If you see a large difference between the bank transaction date and the electronic payment date, make sure to check if the payment was late and work with tax ops to let them know we might incur P&amp;I.&nbsp;</li><li>There are guardrails in place to prevent us from running more than one reconciler job at once. However, we should always make sure the current reconciler job is done before running another. You can check for the reconciliation job here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://app.gusto.com/panda/sidekiq/batches\">https://app.gusto.com/panda/sidekiq/batches</a>. If you do not see it, it's safe to run it again.&nbsp;</li><li>To use the tool, click the 'run reconciler' button that lives on the top right of this page:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://app.gusto.com/panda/run_reconciler_electronic_payment\">https://app.gusto.com/panda/run_reconciler_electronic_payment</a></li></ul><p>A pop-up tool/screen will show up that looks like the below:&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><ac:image><ri:attachment ri:filename=\"run reconciler.png\" /></ac:image></p><h3><u>Each parameter defined</u></h3><ol><li><strong>Bank name</strong><ol><li>This is either PNC or Chase. Select the bank that the transactions are being debited out of.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li><strong>Days before transaction date</strong><ol><li>This is the amount of days the electronic payment was created in our system before the bank transaction.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Days after transaction date&nbsp;</strong><ol><li>This is the amount of days the electronic payment was created in our system after the bank transaction. This is not as common as most electronic payments should be generated before the agency debits us.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li><strong>Operator</strong><ol><li>This gives you the option to say does your bank transaction description 'starts with', 'contains', or 'ends with' a specific string.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li><strong>Description string</strong><ol><li>This is the actual bank description itself. Dependent on your parameter for the operator, you'll want to input this as such so that it matches the bank description.&nbsp;</li></ol></li></ol><p><br /></p><p><strong>Example</strong>: Let's say I want to reconcile all IL unemployment payments that were debited out of SVB for electronic payments that were created within the last 2 weeks.</p><p>Below is what my parameters would look like. The description string can be pulled from any SVB bank transaction for IL and should have a common string that applies to all payments within that agency. To check if the reconciler worked, you can always make note of the bank transaction count on the electronic payments reconciliation page before and after you run the reconciler. If the number drops, congrats it worked! If the number of transactions stayed the same it means none of the transactions meet our reconciliation thresholds and requires us to do some further investigation into what's causing the discrepancy between the electronic payment:bank transaction relationship.&nbsp;</p><p><ac:image><ri:attachment ri:filename=\"run reconciler example.png\" /></ac:image></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>",
