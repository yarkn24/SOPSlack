## üéØ KEY TALKING POINTS (8-10 min)

### 1. PROBLEM (1 min)
**Show:** Redash with blank "Agent" fields

**Say:**
> "Every morning, our recon queue arrives with blank agent fields. Operators used to spend 30-45 minutes manually labeling, looking up SOPs, and screening for priorities before they could even start reconciliation work. CODE7 automates this setup phase."

---

### 2. SOLUTION OVERVIEW (1 min)
**Show:** Architecture diagram

**Say:**
> "CODE7 is a hybrid system: 60% rule-based for deterministic cases, 40% ML for ambiguous patterns. It predicts agent labels, links SOPs, and flags high-impact items. Operators start their day with a pre-populated queue instead of building from scratch."

---

### 3. ARCHITECTURE WALKTHROUGH (2 min)
**Show:** `code7.py` code structure

**Say:**
> "The system fetches unlabeled transactions from Redash API, applies business rules first for clear cases like ZBT transactions or specific account patterns. For ambiguous cases, it uses a RandomForest model trained on historical operator judgments. Then it links the relevant SOP for each agent and generates both CSV and Slack outputs."

**Show flow:**
```
Redash ‚Üí code7.py ‚Üí Rules (60%) ‚Üí ML (40%) ‚Üí SOP Linking ‚Üí Outputs
```

---

### 4. BUSINESS RULES (1.5 min)
**Show:** `labeling_rules.py`

**Point out specific examples:**
```python
# ZBT Skip Rule
if 'zbt' in org_account.lower():
    return None  # Business policy

# Org Account Mapping  
ORG_ACCOUNT_MAP = {
    "ZenPayroll Operations, Inc": "ICP Agent",
    ...
}

# Payment Method Rules
if payment_method == "Wire Transfer" and amount > 10000:
    return "ICP Agent"
```

**Say:**
> "These rules codify our existing reconciliation policies. They're deterministic and cover about 60% of daily transactions. This part could theoretically be done with SQL, which is why we use rules not ML here."

---

### 5. ML MODEL (2 min)
**Show:** `predict_with_rules.py`

**Say:**
> "For the remaining 40% - ambiguous transaction narratives, new patterns, cross-field interpretations - we use machine learning. The model learns from how experienced operators previously resolved similar cases."

**Show key components:**
- Feature engineering (TF-IDF on narratives)
- Model selection (RandomForest won)
- Hybrid logic (rules first, then ML)

**Say:**
> "First attempt was ML-only at 33% accuracy - not usable. After multiple iterations, adding rules, improving features, the hybrid approach reached 98%. This wasn't 'throw ML at the problem' - it was systematic testing to find what works."

**Show validation results:**
```
Baseline: 7% (random guessing, 14 classes)
Rules-only: 60% coverage
ML-only V1: 33% accuracy
Hybrid V4: 98.6% accuracy ‚úì
```

---

### 6. AI DEVELOPMENT PROCESS (1.5 min)
**Show:** Cursor conversation history

**Say:**
> "I built this entirely with Cursor AI Agent. Here's the iterative process:"

**Walk through key prompts:**
1. "Fetch data from Redash and label agents"
2. "Add business rule: never label ZBT transactions"
3. "Create hybrid predictor: rules first, then ML"
4. "Link SOPs to each agent prediction"
5. "Generate Slack-friendly output"
6. "Add banking holiday detection"

**Say:**
> "Prompt engineering was critical. Starting with specific examples and business context worked far better than vague requests. I'll share the full prompt export showing this iteration."

---

### 7. OUTPUTS (1 min)
**Show:** Example CSV file in Excel/Numbers

**Say:**
> "The CSV contains all original transaction fields plus three predicted columns: agent, SOP link, and impact flag."

**Show:** Example Slack message

**Say:**
> "The Slack message gives a daily summary with counts, high-impact alerts, SOP links, and a fun fact for engagement. Currently manual copy-paste, but IT integration is in progress."

---

### 8. BUSINESS IMPACT (1 min)
**Show:** Before/after comparison slide/notes

**Say:**
> "Before CODE7, operators started with a blank queue and built everything manually. After, they start with predictions and just verify. Estimated savings: 1-2 hours per operator, per day - that's about 10 hours per week across the team."

**Show validation plan:**
> "We're currently testing with the team to measure actual prediction acceptance rates, time saved, and manual corrections needed. Those real-world metrics will validate the business value."

## üéØ CLOSING STATEMENT

**Say:**
> "CODE7 demonstrates how AI can augment operational workflows - not replacing human judgment, but codifying expert knowledge and applying it consistently. The hybrid approach was key: rules for deterministic cases, ML for ambiguity. This isn't just a technical experiment - it's designed to save real time and improve consistency in daily operations. I'll follow up with measured validation metrics once testing is complete. Happy to answer any questions."

## ‚ùì ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### Q: "Why not just write more rules?"
**A:** "We tried - rules cover ~60%. The remaining cases involve pattern recognition across narratives and multiple fields that are hard to capture in if/else logic. ML excels at this."

### Q: "How do you handle when the model is wrong?"
**A:** "Operators verify all predictions - it's a starting point, not autopilot. Even wrong predictions are faster to correct than starting from scratch. We'll measure correction rates during testing."

### Q: "What's the IT integration timeline?"
**A:** "CSV and Slack text work today and provide the core value. Full bot integration requires IT approval for tokens - that's in progress but not blocking the system's usability."

### Q: "How do you keep the model up to date?"
**A:** "Future plan: Active learning where operator corrections feed back into retraining. For now, we'll retrain quarterly as we accumulate more data."

### Q: "What if a new transaction type appears?"
**A:** "If it doesn't match rules or ML predicts with low confidence, it's flagged for manual review. Operators add a new rule or the case becomes training data for the model."

## üí° TIPS FOR RECORDING

1. **Speak clearly and conversationally** - not scripted
2. **Show code, don't just talk about it** - visuals matter
3. **Use mouse/cursor to highlight** what you're discussing
4. **Pause briefly between sections** - makes editing easier
5. **If you mess up, just pause and restart that section** - edit later
6. **Demo the actual outputs** - CSV and Slack message
7. **Be honest about current state** - local outputs, IT integration pending
8. **Emphasize the iteration** - 33% ‚Üí 98% shows real engineering
9. **Keep energy up** - enthusiasm is contagious
10. **End with clear next steps** - validation metrics coming
