================================================================================

Wrong DirectionThis alert usually fires off if the system detects that there's two reconciled bank transactions with different directions that are reconciled to transmissions (one credit, one debit)Example: https://app.gusto.com/panda/bank_transactions/32013504 (credit), https://app.gusto.com/panda/bank_transactions/31980934 (debit)The reason these bank transactions have different directions is because the original transaction (credit) was transferred incorrectlyOnce I received the offsetting debit amount, I was able to reconcile both transactions to this electronic payment with the correct amountÂ Sum InvalidThis alert usually fires off if we reconcile a check payment where an adjustment was applied.Example: https://app.gusto.com/panda/bank_transactions/32594371You can see that PNC originally cashed the check incorrectly for $44.23, but the check payment shows $143.00 was supposed to be cashedWe emailed PNC to send us an adjustment for $100.00 so we could make this payment whole and reconcile itThe system thinks the sum is "invalid" because the adjustment for $100.00 came back as an Unknown MethodOnce you verify that the cause of this is due to an adjustment, you can comment on the post for visibilityMissing recordsThese alerts rarely fire off, but in the event they do, please verify if the transaction is reconciled correctly to its appropriate transaction!
