Title: Manual Customer Cash Completeness Checks
URL: https://gustohq.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PlatformOperations/pages/250479204
================================================================================

Gusto needs to perform checks with varying cadence (Weekly, Monthly) on a few reconciliation processes, to ensure that we're not incorrectly creating reporting, reconciling transactions to the wrong transmissions, etc. The #monthly-reconciliation Slack channel will be alerted with a few different alerts that will need to be monitored by a Payment Ops lead/PE. Once the lead/PE has monitored the alert and confirmed that everything looks correct, they will reply in the thread that the checks are complete. The alert will link the operator to this dashboard, where all queries for the multiple reconciliation checks will be. Zoom session (2/25/2025) demo’ing Customer Cash Completeness Checks.Here are the different alerts that the team will be alerted on in the Slack channel:Customer Cash Completeness ChecksTwo checks will involve monitoring the queries nested below.
