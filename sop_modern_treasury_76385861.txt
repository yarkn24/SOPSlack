Modern Treasury DocModern Treasury is thought of as a “wallet” vendor for Gusto. Gusto connects with Modern Treasury once and Modern Treasury is able to connect to multiple Financial Institutions (FI) they are already set up with and can also set up new connections. The advantage of Modern Treasury is a one stop shop to send out payments through instead setting up individual connections for each FIs and logging onto different portals to investigate payment issues. Gusto only has to worry about setting up an account with that FI and Modern Treasury takes care of the connection. This greatly reduces engineering resources for future banking partnerships as Gusto scales. Points of Contact: Modern Treasury Support team - support@moderntreasury.comBrigid Ouellet - Customer Success Manager (CSM) - brigid.ouellet@moderntreasury.comDarragh Buckley - Increase POC - darragh@increase.com Escalation Process as of 3/31/21(WIP)For any sort of connection issues for Increase (Modern Treasury → Increase) Modern Treasury is monitoring in order to identify issues.Slack Increase channel to start troubleshooting + Slack Gusto channel (@here) in order to alert on the issue.

Nachas from BRB → other bank will show up in the pending nacha entry approval queue for Payment Ops to review How are funds distinguished between Same Day and Next Day ACH on Modern Treasury?Will depend on two factors: Priority and Payment DatePriorities will delineate Same Day ACH or Next Day ACH Payment Date = When funds should be credited/debited to/from the counterparty’s (EE/Contractor/ERs) account.How do we know if Payment Orders have been successfully sent over to Increase?Will depend on the status: Approved or CompletedAll Payment Orders will be default “approved” The next step is “completed”, which means the funds have been sent over to Increase for processing. This is ok if the Payment Order IS a SDA, as Modern Treasury will send over entries at usually the latest window in case of cancellations. If the Payment Order is NOT a SDA transaction, this will be indicative that the Payment Order was not sent over to Increase and will need to inquire with Modern Treasury of this break. How do we know if Increase had sent out the payments to the Fed? Will depend if Modern Treasury provides Trace IDs. Trace IDs will be a health check that Increase had sent the files to the Fed (although Increase generates ACH Trace IDs on their own - not a source of truth)Submission Timelines: Gusto3PM PT - Most of the EE and Contractor credits will be submitted here since they are generated between 1-2PM PT6PM PT - Most of the payroll and contractor debits + tax credits6:10PM PT - Most POs will have been submitted - there will be an alert in @payment-alerts stating the completion 6:15 PT - Any POs generated between 6PM - 6:15PM PT (Maybe some tax credits)6:30 PT - Leftovers / late POs6:55 PT - Leftovers / late POsModern Treasury Modern Treasury has two submission windows : 1 hr before and 10 min before Increase cut-offIncrease Increase will send files to the Fed before the cut off time for Same Day/Next Day ACH windows
