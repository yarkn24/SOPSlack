  "content": "<h2>Background:</h2><p>For reconciliations to work, a bank transaction is tied to a payment record which is represented as a transmission. There would often be bank transactions in the Bai Files without an associated transmission.</p><p>Reasons why bank transactions are not tied to a payment record:</p><ul><li><p>Corporate activity (e.g. Treasury funding, interest income, etc)</p></li><li><p>Sweeps between our accounts (e.g. ICP Funding)</p></li></ul><p>If the bank transaction does not have a transmission for the reasons above, then Payment Ops would need to create a new electronic payment and then reconcile it to the bank transaction.</p><h2>Process:&nbsp;</h2><ol start=\"1\"><li><p>Go to the Electronic Payment landing page in Panda. Payment Ops &gt; Financial Cleanup &gt; Electronic Payment Creator. Here is also a direct link to the tool:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://app.gusto.com/panda/electronic_payment_creator#choose_use_case\">https://app.gusto.com/panda/electronic_payment_creator#choose_use_case</a><br /></p><ac:image ac:align=\"left\" ac:layout=\"align-start\" ac:original-height=\"505\" ac:original-width=\"660\" ac:width=\"598\"><ri:attachment ri:filename=\"Screen Shot 2021-08-11 at 1.30.05 PM.png\" ri:version-at-save=\"1\" /></ac:image></li><li><p>In most cases, we will select &quot;<strong>Copy Reporting</strong>&quot; if we know there is an existing transmission.

The new electronic payment will be automatically reconciled to the bank transmission used!</p></li></ol><p /><h2>Custom Reporting (Eng Only)</h2><p>If you need to use the Custom Reporting (Eng Only) flow, use <strong>extreme caution</strong> and always <strong>consult a payments reporting SME</strong> (Ops folks who are fully ramped onto the Payment Investigations rotation) to ensure that your transmission has correct reporting. Incorrect payments reporting data can cause downstream balance validation, customer refund, and Accounting issues.</p><ul><li><p>Query for sample/reference info for the Payment Record Information section: <a href=\"https://redash.zp-int.com/queries/60630/source\">https://redash.zp-int.com/queries/60630/source</a> EP Creator Tool - Custom Reporting flow - Sample PR/PRE info</p></li></ul>",
