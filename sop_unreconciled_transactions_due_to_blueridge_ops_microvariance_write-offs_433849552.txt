================================================================================

🎯 PurposeTo identify and resolve recurring unreconciled transactions caused by the current Modern Treasury’s (MT) reconciliation logic’s inability to handle large volumes of transactions with identical dollar amounts. 📚 BackgroundWe’ve observed a recurring issue over the past few quarters related to unreconciled transactions stemming from Blueridge operations’ microvariance write-offs. The core issue stems from MT’s reconciliation engine struggling to accurately match multiple transactions with the same dollar amount due to its current logic.Since our reconciliation process relies heavily on MT’s API, these transactions fail to be captured automatically, leading to gaps in reconciliation.⚠️ Why This Is Problematic🔍 Data Integrity Risks: Unreconciled transactions undermine the accuracy and reliability of our financial data, leading to incomplete or inconsistent reporting.🤝 Reduced System Trust: Stakeholders lose confidence in our system’s ability to reflect the true financial state.⏳ Operational Inefficiency: Manual interventions increase the risk of human error and slow down financial close processes.📈 Scalability Concerns: Manual workarounds are unsustainable as transaction volumes grow, impacting productivity.💥 Impact🚫 Unreconciled Transactions: A significant volume of distinct payments remain unmatched due to identical values.🛠️ Manual Workarounds: Current manual reconciliation is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and not scalable.❌ MT Support Limitations: MT’s support team has declined manual reconciliation requests due to potential downstream impacts.🛠️ Current Workaround🔎 Manual reconciliation using fuzzy matching techniques to approximate and reconcile transactions with identical dollar amounts that fail strict matching.📄 Usage of an impact sheet documenting affected payments to track unmatched transactions.🚀 Request for ImprovementWe seek to explore a long-term, automated solution that could involve:⚙️ Reviewing and modifying MT’s reconciliation rules or logic to better handle identical-dollar transactions.🤖 Implementing a new reconciliation rule or AI-driven fix to auto-reconcile these transactions efficiently.📉 Reducing manual intervention and improving reconciliation throughput.💸 Impact from last two quarters:Q3 FY25: 855 transactions worth $174.18Q4 FY25: 369 transactions worth $89.44
