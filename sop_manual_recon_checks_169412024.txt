Title: Manual Reconciliation Checks
URL: https://gustohq.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PlatformOperations/pages/169412024
================================================================================

OverviewCurrently there are two manual control checks that are performed to ensure that accurate manual reconciliations are happening and that the manually created transmissions have correct reporting. These checks aren't needed by Platform Accounting to close out the month, but are still necessary to ensure that our team is performing correct reconciliations and correct creation of reporting in our system. The performance of this check happens every Monday and will alert the Payment Operations control group in the #monthly-reconciliations Slack channel. The controls analyst will perform this check on Monday and will look at all manual reconciliations and manually created transmissions from the previous week. When to Perform Checks & What Date ParametersApril 1 Data parameters: March 25-29April 8 April 1-April 5April 15April 8 - April 12April 22April 15 - April 19April 29April 22 - April 26Manual Reconciliation by UserManually Created Transmissions - there are three queries that need to be downloaded for this checkEP Creator Tool - EP CreatedReporting Data Corrector - EP createdRepayment Reporter EP CreatedProceduresManual Reconciliations by UserIt's Monday May 6th and the Manual Reconciliation and Manually Created Transmission Review alert went off in the #monthly-reconciliations Slack channelSince it's May 6th, set the date parameters of the Manual Reconciliations by User query from Monday to Friday of the previous week, so April 29-May3rd. Run the query and download the results as a CSV. The query results show all manually reconciled bank transactions during the selected date parameters that are over $10,000.Create a new Google Sheet in the Manual Reconciliations folder and title it "[Date Parameters] - Manual Reconciliations"Import the CSV into the newly created sheetOnce the data is imported add a new column titled, "Reviewer"The reviewer will look at every line item and determine if the manual reconciliation is correct.Somethings to consider when reviewing a manual reconciliationWhy did this need to be manually reconciled? The Payment Ops team usually leaves a comment in the column called "body" that gives a reason why a manual reconciliation needed to be performed. Does the origination account of the bank transaction and the transmission match?How do we know this reconciliation is correct? Does the description on the bank transaction match the reporting on the transmission?Does the payment event balance look correct (e.g. are we holding onto more than what's needed/do we have any double wires that may have been accidentally reconciled to the same event?)If something doesn't look right, you can ask the person who reconciled the transaction in the #payment-ops-recon Slack channelThe Payment Ops team member who reconciled the transaction is shown both on the bank transaction Panda page and the Google sheetIf the manual reconciliation looks correct, then you can populate the "Reviewer" column for that row with your name and date of reviewIf all bank transactions have been reviewed and the reviewer column has been populated, then post an update in the #monthly-reconciliations Slack channel as a thread under the alert that fired off and paste the folder where all the manual reconciliation controls are saved.Manually Created TransmissionsIt's Monday May 6th and the Manual Reconciliation and Manually Created Transmission Review alert went off in the #monthly-reconciliations Slack channelSince it's May 6th, set the date parameters of these three queries from Monday to Friday of the previous week, so April 29-May3rd. EP Creator Tool - EP CreatedReporting Data Corrector - EP createdRepayment Reporter EP CreatedDownload the results of all 3 queries as a CSV.
