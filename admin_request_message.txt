Hi team! 👋

I'm working on a daily reconciliation automation bot for Platform Operations and need Slack admin approval.

**App Name:** SlackSOPTest
**Purpose:** Automate daily bank transaction reconciliation messages
**Status:** Pending approval in admin queue

**What it does:**
• Posts daily reconciliation summaries to #platform-operations
• Shows agent predictions (ACH, Check, Risk, etc.) with ML model (98.64% accuracy)
• Alerts on high-volume transactions (40+, 50+ warnings)
• Flags high-value ICP transactions ($300K+)
• Provides clickable SOP links for the team
• Warns about upcoming US banking holidays

**Permissions needed:**
• chat:write - send messages
• chat:write.public - post to public channels
• channels:read - view channel info
• users:read - display user names

**Business impact:**
• Current: ~5 min/transaction manual labeling (50-150 daily)
• After: <1 second prediction per transaction
• Saves: 4-12 hours/day for the team

**Security:**
✅ Cannot read private messages or DMs
✅ Cannot access message history
✅ Only posts to public channels
✅ No data stored externally

**Who can approve this?**

You can find "SlackSOPTest" in the pending apps queue:
https://gusto.enterprise.slack.com/admin/apps/pending

Or let me know who I should contact for app approvals.

Thanks! 🙏
