Gusto connects with Modern Treasury once and Modern Treasury is able to connect to multiple Financial Institutions (FI) they are already set up with and can also set up new connections. The advantage of Modern Treasury is a one stop shop to send out payments through instead setting up individual connections for each FIs and logging onto different portals to investigate payment issues. Gusto only has to worry about setting up an account with that FI and Modern Treasury takes care of the connection. This greatly reduces engineering resources for future banking partnerships as Gusto scales.&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href=\"https://gustohq.atlassian.net/wiki/display/RO/In+Case+of+Emergency+Contacts\"><strong>Points of Contact:&nbsp;</strong></a></p><p><strong>Modern Treasury Support team - <span style=\"color: rgb(34,34,34);\"><a href=\"mailto:support@moderntreasury.com\">support@moderntreasury.com</a></span></strong></p><p><strong>Brigid Ouellet - Customer Success Manager (CSM) - <span class=\"il\"><span style=\"color: rgb(34,34,34);\"><a class=\"c-link\" href=\"mailto:brigid.ouellet@moderntreasury.com\" style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">brigid.ouellet@moderntreasury.com</a></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Darragh Buckley - Increase POC - <a href=\"mailto:darragh@increase.com\">darragh@increase.com</a>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ebqaA5C5ntp-0r_GtU5zlm3zGzo1PwwjEpJmLPIQauc/edit?usp=sharing\">Escalation Process</a> as of 3/31/21(WIP)</strong></p><p><strong>For any sort of connection issues for Increase (Modern Treasury &rarr; Increase)&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li>Modern Treasury is monitoring in order to identify issues.</li><li>Slack Increase channel to start troubleshooting + Slack Gusto channel (@here) in order to alert on the issue.
